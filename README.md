I created this game for my friends and I to play. We enjoy the game catch phrase but wanted to customize our own categories and word pools. It is meant to only be used on a mobile device because the game play requires passing a device around.<br>
<br>Rules:<br>◦ Add the categories you would like at the bottom (ex. cinema, travel, celebrities etc.) then add the words you would like to each category.
<br>◦ Then divide your players into teams (red and blue.)
<br>◦ After you have added a sufficient amount of content pick a category and hit select. A 60 second countdown timer will then begin and you must try to describe the word to your teammate without using parts of the word or rhyming then pass the phone to the next player.
<br>◦ This continues until time runs out and the player who is holing the device when time runs out must give the other team a point. 
<br>◦ This cycle continues until a team gets 7 points and wins guess it!
